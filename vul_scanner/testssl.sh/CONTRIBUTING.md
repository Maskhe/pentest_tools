### Contributions / participation

is always welcome.

Note please that following is strongly requested:

* One PR per feature or bug fix or improvement.
* Document your PR properly, both in the PR and/or commit message and in the code.
* Please test your changes thoroughly as reliability is important for this project.
* Follow the length [coding guideline](https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh/wiki/Coding-Style). 


If it's a new feature please consider writing a unit test for it. There's a directory ~/t/ which Travis runs automatically when anything is committed.  You can use e.g. `20_baseline_ipv4_http.t` as a template. There's also [general documentation for Test::More](https://perldoc.perl.org/Test/More.html).
